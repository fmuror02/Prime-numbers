INTRUCTIONS OF DEPLOYMENT:

1. In the Setup folder open a python file called goPrime, which makes the other 2 python files (py) work.
2. When you run the code you have to introduce the highest number the code can generate (we can't have infinite because the program may shut down)
3. The highest prime number obtained and the number of digits will be stored in to text files:
	'Prime numbers.txt' and 'Digits.txt'
